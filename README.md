# byuu's emulator development resources (archived)

After byuu/near retired in July 2020,
he took his various websites offline
since he was no longer willing to maintain them.

However,
since they contained a lot of useful information and wisdom
about the design and implementation of emulators,
the most important and useful information has been collected and preserved here.
