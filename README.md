# byuu's emulator development resources (archived)

After byuu/near retired in July 2020,
he took his various websites offline
since he was no longer willing to maintain them.

However,
since they contained a lot of useful information and wisdom
about the design and implementation of emulators,
the most important and useful information has been collected and preserved here.

This content has been manually converted to Markdown for ease of presentation;
if you find any conversion errors, please [file an

If you'd like to contribute an article of your own about some aspect of emulator
design or implementation, please [create a pull
request](https://github.com/byuu/byuu.net/pulls)!
