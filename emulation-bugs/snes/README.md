Some games work flawlessly even on wildly inaccurate emulators,
others require exact emulation of subtle behaviour
(and even then [some](../../game-bugs/snes/) still don't work).

# Nuke (PD)

Inputs do not work unless auto joypad polling is correct.

# Super Conflict

Sends random inputs even with no buttons pressed,
unless auto joypad polling is correct.

# Super Star Wars

Start button auto-unpauses
unless auto joypad polling is correct.

# Taikyoku Igo - Goliath

Start button does not work at the title screen
unless auto joypad polling is correct.

# Tatakae Genshijin 2

Attract sequence ends early
unless auto joypad polling is correct.

# Williams Arcade's Greatest Hits

Inputs fire on their own,
or menu items sometimes skipped
unless auto joypad polling is correct.

# World Masters Golf

Inputs fail to register
and holding D-pad only moves the cursor once
(instead of continuously)
unless auto joypad polling is correct.

TODO: I don't know what versions of what emulators
exhibit this behaviour, more testing needed.
